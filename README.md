# Random Ideas
This repo is just a dumping ground for my random ideas. 

Each idea will have it's own MarkDown file, explaining the core of the idea, as well as any other ideas relating to that core. Each file will also have a section reserved towards the bottom where anyone who wants to work on making that idea can have their repository listed.

Some ideas will be more thoroughly fleshed out than others. As stated, this is just meant to be a dumping ground where I can put any ideas I have. Maybe I come back and flesh them out later, maybe I don't, maybe I chose to work on some of them, or maybe I leave them for the wider Internet to run with.

The list of ideas and links to their respective files can be found below.
